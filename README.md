## Star the repo?

If you think [this repo](https://github.com/GmBodhi/create-three-app/stargazers) is worth a starâœ¨ just don't hesitate :)

### Note: We don't recommend installing this package globally.

## Usage

#### Run with `--help` flag to know more!

```sh
npx create-three-app {dir_name}
```

or

```sh
yarn create three-app {dir_name}
```

## Using an example from threejs.org/examples

You need to run the command with `-i` or `-e` flag.
Example: \

```sh
# -i or --interactive
npx create-three-app -i

# You can specify the name of the example.
yarn create three-app -e webgl_shader
```

We don't recommend this for beginners, as there can be some bugs that you may have to resolve manually (converting examples to webpack (node) compatible packages is an [automated task](https://github.com/GmBodhi/create-three-app/actions/workflows/examples.yml)) to work everything correctly or even starting the server. You may check `assets.json` for information about unresolved URLs, which may or may not stop the web server from initiating, or the unexpected behaviour of the website.
