## Using an example from threejs.org/examples

We don't recommend this for beginners, as there can be some bugs that you may have to resolve manually (converting examples to webpack (node) compatible packages is an [automated task](https://github.com/GmBodhi/create-three-app/actions/workflows/examples.yml)) to work everything correctly or even starting the server. You may check `assets.json` for information about unresolved URLs, which may or may not stop the web server from initiating, or the unexpected behaviour of the website.
